### Simple Spreadsheet Web App

#### Problem Statement

In many cases, essential dataâ€”such as pricing quotes, product availability, or specific detailsâ€”is not readily accessible online and requires direct communication, typically through phone calls. Manually collecting this information is a slow and inefficient process, particularly when managing multiple entries or sources. Users need a streamlined solution to gather this data without disrupting their workflow or leaving their workspace.

#### Solution

This web app offers a simple spreadsheet interface for users to input and organize data, with a standout feature: the **"Populate" button**, marked with a phone symbol (ðŸ“ž). This button enables users to select cells and trigger an external microservice to make a phone call, retrieving the necessary data (e.g., pricing quotes unavailable online). The microservice processes the call and returns the information, which is then automatically filled into the selected cells. This seamless integration makes the app a powerful tool for efficiently collecting data that cannot be sourced digitally, forming its central value proposition.
